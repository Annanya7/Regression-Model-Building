# Regression-Model-Building
Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression: a technique in which a straight line is used to estimate the relationship between two interval/ratio variables. The line that minimizes the sum of the squared errors (the distance between the line and each observation) is said to be the "best-fitting line."

Polynomial Regression:It is a form of linear regression in which the relationship between x and y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial.
